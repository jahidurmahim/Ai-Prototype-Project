üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Cheat Detection AI
A real-time AI solution that monitors candidates and detects suspicious activities during virtual interviews.

üîç Features
- Face Detection: Detects if a person is present.
- Multiple Face Detection: Raises alert if more than one face is visible.
- Face Distance: Checks if the person is sitting too far.
- Gaze Detection: Tracks eye movement to detect if the user is looking away.
- Face Recognition: Verifies if the user matches a stored image.
- Object Detection: Detects mobile phones or unauthorized items.
- Spoof Detection: Detects fake face attempts (e.g., using a photo).
